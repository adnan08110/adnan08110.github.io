<h1>Welcome to the Adnanese corner of the internet!</h1>
<br>
<h3>A cool intro, I guess...</h3>
<p>My name is Adnan Mohamoud, and I am just a curious guy sometimes. I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@adnan_2k">youtube channel</a>. I sometimes take massive breaks, but that's because I usually run out of ideas. But don't worry, because I'm going to deal with that issue very soon.</p>

<h3>Games I play</h3>
<p>I am not much of a gamer. Sometimes, I feel like I don't have much time, or I am too busy editing/workin on the next video. Also, the pc at home isn't really built for gaming, so that limits my options. I am broke too, but yeah. I only really play Minecraft (which I pirated) and Brawlhalla. Brawlhala is so damn good, if you ask me. It's definitely worth a shot.</p>

<h3>More about me!</h3>
<p>I don't really program much either, but that is changing. I am relearning html and you are reading my work right now. If you're broke (like me), you can use github pages to host your website for free. Even though you can't customise the url, it's worth it.</p>
<p>Here is a video I made a while ago. Check it out, please.</p>
